        The End of Trial-and-Error Coding: AI Is Reshaping Software Engineering into a Structured Discipline
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        With all the recent advancements in AI-assisted software development, we frequently get asked where software development is headed by young engineers we speak to at engineering institutions and at businesses we advise. GreyNeuron's take on this is that AI will <b>lead in the green field projects</b>, that most <b>Human Developers will become system integrators</b>, and that <b>AI will pose more challenges for entry level jobs</b>. <b>Design thinking, Critical thinking, and System thinking </b> all become crucial to succeed in you careers. Finally, since the <b>boss cannot dismiss the AI, so Human Devs will continue to be needed</b>.

        <div class="content">
          While NVIDIA is firmly entrenched as the dominant player in AI with its indispensable chips required for AI workload, the AI hardware market is undergoing a seismic shift. Competitors like AMD and Intel, as well as tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, are making strides in a race to catchup with NVIDIA. That said, NVIDIA’s software ecosystem remains its ultimate moat. 
          Let'sexplore why NVIDIA is so hard to beat, where its competitors stand, and whether the industry can unite to create a common software ecosystem that challenges NVIDIA’s supremacy. Read more...

      As part of database tuning services, the first step when we engage on a database tuning assignment is review indexes & create them to speed up the queries. This is the first tool in our arsenal and very effective one. 
      
      We work mainly on open source databases mainly on MySQL and PostgreSQL. Both these relational database use different types of indexes, with B-tree being the default in most cases. This blog explores B-tree and hash indexes, their use cases, advantages, and how they work in MySQL and PostgreSQL...
