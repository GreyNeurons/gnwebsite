          Software the real moat of NVIDIA
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          While NVIDIA is firmly entrenched as the dominant player in AI with its indispensable chips required for AI workload, the AI hardware market is undergoing a seismic shift. Competitors like AMD and Intel, as well as tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta, are making strides in a race to catchup with NVIDIA. That said, NVIDIA’s software ecosystem remains its ultimate moat. 
          Let'sexplore why NVIDIA is so hard to beat, where its competitors stand, and whether the industry can unite to create a common software ecosystem that challenges NVIDIA’s supremacy. Read more...

        Understanding B-Trees and Hash Indexes in MySQL and PostgreSQL
      </div>

      As part of database tuning services, the first step when we engage on a database tuning assignment is review indexes & create them to speed up the queries. This is the first tool in our arsenal and very effective one. 
      
      We work mainly on open source databases mainly on MySQL and PostgreSQL. Both these relational database use different types of indexes, with B-tree being the default in most cases. This blog explores B-tree and hash indexes, their use cases, advantages, and how they work in MySQL and PostgreSQL.

      Recently in a code review session for a product under development, got to know the team was using Firebase for in-app notifications. Looked like a reasonable choice nevertheless reminded me of the infamous story how a startup almost went bankrupt using Firebase. I shared the story with the team & requested them to apply learnings if any from the same.
