        RAG in the Real World: A Candid Q&A on Building Smarter AI Chatbots
      </div>
      
      <div class="content">

        <p>Language models like GPT are amazing, but they're trained on static datasets and often don't know your internal product details or recent changes. They hallucinate when they're unsure, confidently making up answers.
        RAG fixes that by letting the model look things up in real-time. It retrieves relevant content (like docs, help articles, code), then feeds it to the LLM as context. So the model's answer is grounded in your actual data - not guesswork.</p>

        <p>I’ve been a ChatGPT Plus subscriber for quite some time. At $20/month, it has served me well — helping me brainstorm ideas, prepare proposal drafts, simplify dense cybersecurity topics, and even generate the occasional blog image with DALL·E.

          But recently, I’ve started rethinking this fixed subscription</p>

        How I Built a Reusable Social-Share Web Component with ChatGPT in 17 Minutes
      </div>
      
      <div class="content">

        <p>Over the past few months, I’ve been on a Medium publishing spree – writing deep dives and how-tos for my growing audience. To make my work accessible to non-members, I mirror every post on my own static site: no fancy frameworks, just plain HTML and CSS. As traffic climbed, I found myself wishing there was a simple way for readers to share these articles across their social networks.</p>

        <p>These days, whenever I want to do any coding, I just ask ChatGPT. For most small tweaks and feature add-ons, it’s a lean, lightning-fast way to get exactly what I need without the overhead of heavyweight AI or non-AI based Dev tools. Adding a social share feature fit the bill of getting it done using AI.</p>
        
        <p>In this post, I’ll walk you through the exact prompts I used, the code we generated together, how long it took, and the lessons learned along the way.</p>

      <p>In an earlier article, we introduced the NIST Cybersecurity Framework - one of the most widely adopted standards for structuring an organization's security posture. We also explored how a curated set of open-source and free tools, chosen for their ease of installation and real-world usefulness, can be mapped to the five NIST functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.</p>
      
      <p>In this article, we're jumping into one of the tools from that stack: Snipe-IT. It's a free, open-source asset management tool that helps you catalog your organization's assets such as laptops, phones, routers, licenses, cloud accounts, and more. In this guide, we'll walk you through setting it up locally and adding your first real-world assets - all mapped to the Identify function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.</p>

        Security threats feel more real than ever, yet businesses - especially SMBs - struggle to build a strong defensive strategy on a budget. Most don't fail because of a lack of tools - they fail because no one tells them how to stitch those tools together into a real security strategy. Enter NIST CSF (Cybersecurity Framework) and open-source tools. In this series, we'll explore how to align community-backed solutions with NIST's five core functions - Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover - to create a robust, affordable security stack that just works.
