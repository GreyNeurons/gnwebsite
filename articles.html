                The software practitioners from today's age would agree not much has changed 
                in terms of software development. New programming languages, frameworks & libraries 
                have come but challenges of changing requirements, estimation overruns and 
                quality problems continue to be same as what it was 30 - 40 years ago.

            <div class="block"> Erlang was invented at Ericssion by Joe armstrong & others to specifically meet the 
            then telecom giants requirements to have a highly scalabable/concurrent fault tolerant
            systems.
            
            Even after being opensourced in late 1990 it was not highly 
            popular till late 2000 as it lacked any big corporate backing & 
            was always considered a niche langauge.
            </div> 

            <div class="block">Mid 2000 , need for internet scale ( where you may have 100Ks of concurrent users unlike 
            100s in enterprise software ) forced the programming community to reconsider Erlang. 
            The biggest evidence of this is WhatsApp where the core messaging 
            services are written in Erlang. </div>
            
            <div class="block">At times people have complained about Erlangs quirky syntax and lack of modern tooling, 
                Elixir latest functional programming language on the block is addressing it by taking the syntax and tools from Ruby on Rail 
            but using BEAM ( the Erlang's VM) under the hood with a hope to give best of both the world.</div>

            <div class="block">So if you are starting fresh building a product for cloud/internet scale then
              you can not ignore Erlang/Elixir.
