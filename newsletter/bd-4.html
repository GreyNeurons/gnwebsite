                <h1>Agile Wins, ARM Savings, Secure Open Source, and Smarter MySQL -All in One Dispatch</h1>

                <p>

                    Every week, I come across a handful of things that make me pause and think, "More dev teams should know this." Sometimes it's a tiny process tweak. Sometimes it's an underused AWS option. Sometimes it's just a smarter default you didn't realize was already helping you out.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    In this edition, I'm sharing four such picks: an agile habit that actually works, an easy AWS cost saver, a way to spot trustworthy open source tools, and a MySQL tip that might save you hours of tuning. No fluff - just things you can put to use right away.

                <h2>💡 Quick Thought</h2>
                <p>
                    Developers <strong>hate meetings</strong> - fair. But if I had to pick just <strong>one ritual and one metric</strong> to boost delivery, it'd be: <br>
                        <div class="block is-centered">
                        Ritual: Daily standups <br>
                        Metric: Work In Progress (WIP) per developer - keep it between 1.0 and 1.25 <br>
                        </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <blockquote>WIP = Total open work items / # of developers</blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Teams that <strong>keep WIP under control ship faster</strong> and break less.
                </p>

                <h2>💸 Start with AWS Graviton Instances</h2>

                <p>
                    <p>
                    If you're just getting started with AWS—or looking to cut cloud costs—my first recommendation is simple: <strong>go Graviton</strong> 
                    </p>

                    <p>They're up to <strong>40% cheaper than x86</strong> EC2, with better performance per dollar. One of the reason they are cheaper is because the <strong>graviton processor is designed by Amazon</strong> and of course they want to promote it.                     A handy tool for directly <strong>comparing Graviton instances with other EC2 types</strong> is available <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://greyneuronsconsulting.com/tools/gravitonsavings/graviton.html">here.</a>
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>For most workloads, it's a no-brainer, just make sure <strong>your stack is ARM-compatible</strong>, and you're set to save. You can read more about Graviton

                <h2>🦉Words of Wisdom</h3> 

                <p> 
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><i>The gap between the best software engineering practice and the average practice is very wide - perhaps wider than in any other engineering discipline. A tool that disseminates good practice would be important. - Fred Brooks</i></p>

                <h2>🛡️ Open Source Security, Ranked</h2>
                <p>
                    The Open Source Security Index is designed to make it easier to discover high-quality open source security projects. It ranks projects on GitHub using an "Index Score" - a weighted average of key metrics retrieved monthly from GitHub and normalized on a 0–100 scale. You can read more about it

                <h2>🛠️ MySQL on Dedicated Servers: Smarter Defaults</h2>
                <p>
                    If you're running MySQL on a dedicated server, you might not need to obsess over config tuning anymore. MySQL has long supported <strong>automatic configuration adjustments </strong> based on detected system resources.
                    It dynamically sets values like innodb_buffer_pool_size, max_connections, and table_open_cache based on available RAM and CPU. You can read more about it
