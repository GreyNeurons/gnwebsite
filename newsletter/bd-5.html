                <p id="cursor">
                    Ever wonder how the <strong>Cursor AI code editor actually works</strong> under the hood? Roman Imankulov takes you on a behind-the-scenes tour, breaking down how it turns your vague coding requests into actual changes across your files. 
                    
                    <strong>He digs into how Cursor structures its prompts</strong>, how you can shape its behavior with a simple config file, and how it <strong>smartly uses OpenAI‚Äôs function-calling</strong> to do things like search your codebase or edit files. <br>
                    
                    It‚Äôs a solid peek into how modern AI dev tools really tick.

                    <p>C has taken a beating lately for <strong>not being memory safe</strong> ‚Äî and <strong>Rust is gaining traction precisely</strong> because of that. To make matters worse, <strong>CISA is now pushing software vendors to move away from memory-unsafe languages</strong> altogether. Major tech players have already started backing Rust, rewriting parts of their system software in it.</p>

                    <p> Against this backdrop, <strong>Robin Rowe‚Äôs proposal for the TrapC extension to C is potentially game-changing</strong>. According to the proposal, compiling C code with a TrapC-aware compiler <strong>automatically upgrades all pointers to Memory Safe Pointers, with built-in checks and enhanced error handling mechanisms</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Rowe asserts <strong>TrapC is on track to be released in 2025</strong>. If done well this can totally <strong>kill the C to Rust migration industry</strong>. It will be interesting to see how this unfolds.</p>

                <p id="curl">
                    <p>Curl runs on everything ‚Äî from your laptop to your router to your fridge. With <strong>20 billion installs</strong> (probably more), its creator Daniel Stenberg knows the stakes are high. In a refreshingly honest and funny FOSDEM talk, he explains how Curl <strong>stays secure without chasing trendy rewrites</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Instead of ditching C, they double down on discipline. Dangerous <strong>functions like gets() and sprintf() are outright banned</strong>. They <strong>torture-test</strong> their code by forcing memory allocation failures just to make sure nothing crashes or leaks. Every single <strong>pull request triggers over 400,000 tests</strong>, now optimized to run in just 30 minutes. Even the indentation, spelling, and documentation style are automatically checked‚Äîyes, contractions like ‚Äúisn‚Äôt‚Äù are forbidden.</p>

                    <p>Stenberg also dives into their bug bounty program, which has paid <strong>out over $85,000</strong> since 2019. But not everything submitted is gold ‚Äî <strong>AI-generated ‚Äúslop‚Äù now accounts for about 10‚Äì15%</strong> of all reports. Despite that, the team takes every bug seriously, and even acts as its own CVE-numbering authority to speed up disclosures.</p>

                    <p>There‚Äôs <strong>no big re-write in sight</strong> ‚Äî just a relentless <strong>commitment to doing things right, one test, one audit, one release</strong> at a time.</p>

                    <p><strong>Code as Content: A Thought</strong></p>

                    <p>
                    I‚Äôve been thinking about this more lately ‚Äî especially after reading a post on ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù. Just like software engineers are now casually writing blog posts or recording short explainers, <strong>AI is enabling non-coders to generate code as a form of content</strong>. Not to ship. Not to maintain. <strong>Just to share an idea or make a point</strong>.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    But here‚Äôs the catch: most of that <strong>code has a shelf life of maybe a few days</strong>. It‚Äôs not getting versioned, deployed, or even revisited. So installing things, setting up local environments ‚Äî it all starts to feel like overkill.
                    </p>

                    <p> This kind of throwaway, in-browser code? <strong>JavaScript wins</strong> by default.</p>
                   
                    <p>
                    Meanwhile, <strong>long-lived software ‚Äî enterprise systems, avionics, anything with safety requirements ‚Äî still demands structure, determinism, and actual engineering</strong>. That code will be written by humans (for now), likely with AI assisting quietly in the background.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        So yeah, <strong>not all code is built to last. Some of it is built to click</strong>.
                    </p>
