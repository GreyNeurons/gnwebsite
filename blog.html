          Introduction to Java records

      <div class="content mx-6">
        <p> The biggest criticism on Java is the large amount of boilerplate code it 
          forces one to write. Python and newer languages like Kotlin seem to score over 
          Java on this front..
        </p>

        <p>
          Boilerplate code is not always bad. Sometimes verbose code is easy to understand 
          and maintain especially if you are working with relative junior team members 
          with a high churn rate.

        </p>
        <p>
          However one case where boilerplate code is pure waste is when you have a java 
          class with nothing more then half a dozen or more getter/setter. 
          To make it worst, in a large project worth it’s salt you would be have 
          dozens of classes like this.
        </p>

        <p>
          Java Records a new feature in JDK 14 onwards comes to rescue. 
          Each of the boilerplate data class described above now can be define in one 
          single line. This is fantastic addition to Java and in our opinion will go down as 
          a pathbreaking feature in history of Java.

          So if you have are working on a project that uses Java 14 or higher & your java class seems to 
          have a lot of getter / setters, it is time for you to Java records.

          Nano Refactoring — Leave the campground cleaner than you found it
        </p>  
      </header>

      <div class="content mx-6">
        <p> The Boy Scouts of America have a simple rule — ‘Leave the campground 
          cleaner than you found it’*.
        </p>

        <p>
        Applying this to context of software development especially for a large complex 
        legacy code base, what essentially it means when you get to modifying a legacy 
        code base for a specific bug fix, can we do some quick refactoring around 
        the code you are modifying. I call this as <strong>‘Nano Refactoring’</strong>.

        </p>

        <p> 
          The campground for Nano Refactoring is the ‘function’ being modified for 
          specific bug fix. The type of clean up done under Nano Refactoring must fit 
          into ‘Low Effort &amp; Low Risk’ category such as
          <p>
            <li>
              Appropriate commenting (add/remove/modify).
            </li>
            <li>
              Rename any local variables per guidelines.
            </li>
            <li>
              Removal of duplicate variables etc.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additional assert, try catch for better error handling.
            </li>

          </p>
          <p>
            These nano refactoring efforts looked in isolation can be dismissed as 
            trivial but the aggregation of these marginal gains can be significant 
            in the long run. If each function/class/module was cleaned up by 1% every day, 
            at the end of one year you would have 37% of your code base cleaned up almost 
            with no addition efforts or risks.

        <p>  
          Tribe of Hackers is a collection of interviews with 70 cyber security experts. 
          Interview questions asked to these cyber security experts is standard.
          Questions cover wide topics related to cyber security from cybersecurity tools/technolgies, processes 
          to making careers in cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>
          if you had to jot down the most common advise given by these 70 odd experts, 
          it would really come down to following 
          <p>
          
            For Individuals, you need to do following 
            <li>Use strong password ( min 16 digits, alphanumeric + special characters ).</li>
            <li>Do not repeat passwords across sites.</li>
            <li>Use password manager ( it takes care of both of the above items ).</li>
            <li>Use VPN.</li>
          </p>

          <p>
            For Organizations, resoundingly the advice is 
            <li>Focus on people then tools ( Training budget / Tools budget may be a good metrics to track )</li>  
          </p>

        </p>

        <p> 
          Obviosly insane focus on buying more tools , technologies is not helping any one 
          because tools do end up creating tons and tons of data with very minimal ways to auto remediate the situation.
          Tool implementation eats up so much budget which results in reduced budget for staffing and training.
        </p>

        <p>Setting target attribute of anchor tag to '_blank' is quite common when you want

        by adding a <b>rel</b> attribute to anchor tag and setting it to <b>"noreferrer noopener"</b>

        How gracefully you handle errors in your code differentiates a professional 
        coder from a rookie programmer. All the modern language give capabilties like try catch 
        to handle error conditions. 
        In this <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
        href="https://blog.frankel.ch/error-handling/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">article</a> , author looks at handling errors using traditional
        constructs like try & catch in languages like Java, Python, Rust but then more importantly 
        discusses how error handling can achieved using functional programming concepts.

            The software practitioners from today's age would agree not much has changed 
            in terms of software development. New programming languages, frameworks & libraries 
            have come but challenges of changing requirements, estimation overruns and 
            quality problems continue to be same as what it was 30 - 40 years ago.

          Elixir is the future of Erlang

        <div class="block"> Erlang was invented at Ericssion by 
        <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)">Joe armstrong</a> 
        & others to specifically meet the 
        then telecom giants requirements to have a highly scalabable/concurrent fault tolerant
        systems. Erlang is largely functional concurrency oriented prorgamming language. 
        
        Even after being opensourced in late 1990 it was not very 
        popular  as it lacked  big corporate sponsorship & 
        was always considered a niche langauge.
        </div> 

        <div class="block">Mid 2000s , need for internet scale ( where you may have 100Ks of concurrent users unlike 
        100s in enterprise software ) forced the programming community to reconsider Erlang. 
        The biggest evidence of this is WhatsApp where the core messaging 
        services are written in Erlang. </div>

        <div class="block">
          Functional programming paradigm existed since early 1950 but had remained confined to universities & academia. 
          Late 2000 saw a renewed interest in functional programming and corporates especially startups were open to adapting
          functional programming in mainstream product development. While the interest in Erlang was on rise, people still had 
          concerns about Erlangs quirky syntax and lack of modern tooling.
        </div>
        
        <div class="block">Around 2010 , Jose Valim a core team member of Ruby on Rails team was working to improve the 
          performance of Rails which had challenges with its concurrency implementation. 
          As a solution to Rails concurrency issues, Jose valim ended up creating Elixir language.
          Elixir while not a fully functional language like Haskell adapted the syntax & tools from 
          Ruby on rails but under the hood decided to use BEAM, the rock solid super concurrent virtual machine of Erlang.
          Essentially with this Jose had solved two problems -> concurrency issus of Ruby, quirky syntax/lack of tools on Erlang.

        <div class="block">So next time  when you need to build highly distributed systems that need low latency (soft real time) 
          and high reliability, Elixir is the way to go.
