          2 April 2022 | Beware when you use target="_blank" next time

      <div class="content mx-6">
        <p>Setting target attribute of anchor tag to '_blank' is quite common when you want 
        to open the link in a new tab of the browser. What is not commonly understood is this
        can lead to a vulnerability known as <a class="has-text-info" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabnabbing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tabnabbing</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>You can easily avoid this potential vulnerability
        by adding a <b>rel</b> attribute to anchor tag and setting it to <b>"noreferrer noopener"</b>
        </p>  
        So next time you write a code which looks like
            
            <xmp class="code-border">
              <a href="https://www.greyneuronconsulting.com" target="_blank">Grey Neurons consulting</a>
            </xmp>  
        
            take an extra moment and don't forget to add the rel attribute
            <xmp class="code-border">
              <a href="https://www.greyneuronconsulting.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

          31 March 2022 | Handling Errors Functional programming way

      <div class="content mx-6">
        
        How gracefully you handle errors in your code differentiates a professional 
        coder from a rookie. All the modern language give capabilties like try catch 
        to handle error conditions. 
        In this <a class="has-text-info" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
        href="https://blog.frankel.ch/error-handling/?utm_source=pocket_mylist">article</a> , author looks at handling errors using traditional
        constructs like try & catch in languages like Java, Python, Rust but then more importantly 
        discusses how error handling can achieved using functional programming concepts.

            quality problems continue to be same as what it was 30 - 40 years ago.

        <div class="block"> Erlang was invented at Ericssion by Joe armstrong & others to specifically meet the 
        then telecom giants requirements to have a highly scalabable/concurrent fault tolerant
        systems.
        
        Even after being opensourced in late 1990 it was not highly 
        popular till late 2000 as it lacked any big corporate backing & 
        was always considered a niche langauge.
        </div> 

        <div class="block">Mid 2000 , need for internet scale ( where you may have 100Ks of concurrent users unlike 
        100s in enterprise software ) forced the programming community to reconsider Erlang. 
        The biggest evidence of this is WhatsApp where the core messaging 
        services are written in Erlang. </div>
        
        <div class="block">At times people have complained about Erlang's quirky syntax and lack of modern tooling, 
            Elixir latest functional programming language on the block is addressing it by taking the syntax and tools from Ruby on Rail 
        but using BEAM ( the Erlang's VM) under the hood with a hope to give best of both the world.</div>

        <div class="block">So if you are starting fresh building a product for cloud/internet scale then
          you can not ignore Erlang/Elixir.
