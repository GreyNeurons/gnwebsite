  <meta name="description" content="A software engineering blog about anything everything on software development 
  right from requirements, estimation architecture, design , coding to QA & support. 
  We talk about python, java,Elixir, Erlang. We cover functional programming paradigms vs imperative. 
  We talk about people issues effecting most software teams. We look at full stack development equally 
  focusing on backend and frontend. ">

        <div class="block"> Erlang was invented at Ericssion by 
        <a  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" 
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Armstrong_(programmer)">Joe armstrong</a> 
        & others to specifically meet the 
        then telecom giants requirements to have a highly scalabable/concurrent fault tolerant
        systems. Erlang is largely functional concurrency oriented prorgamming language. 
        
        Even after being opensourced in late 1990 it was not very 
        popular  as it lacked  big corporate sponsorship & 
        was always considered a niche langauge.
        </div> 

        <div class="block">Mid 2000s , need for internet scale ( where you may have 100Ks of concurrent users unlike 
        100s in enterprise software ) forced the programming community to reconsider Erlang. 
        The biggest evidence of this is WhatsApp where the core messaging 
        services are written in Erlang. </div>

        <div class="block">
          Functional programming paradigm existed since early 1950 but had remained confined to universities & academia. 
          Late 2000 saw a renewed interest in functional programming and corporates especially startups were open to adapting
          functional programming in mainstream product development. While the interest in Erlang was on rise, people still had 
          concerns about Erlangs quirky syntax and lack of modern tooling.
        </div>
        
        <div class="block">Around 2010 , Jose Valim a core team member of Ruby on Rails team was working to improve the 
          performance of Rails which had challenges with its concurrency implementation. 
          As a solution to Rails concurrency issues, Jose valim ended up creating Elixir language.
          Elixir while not a fully functional language like Haskell adapted the syntax & tools from 
          Ruby on rails but under the hood decided to use BEAM, the rock solid super concurrent virtual machine of Erlang.
          Essentially with this Jose had solved two problems -> concurrency issus of Ruby, quirky syntax/lack of tools on Erlang.

        <div class="block">So next time  when you need to build highly distributed systems that need low latency (soft real time) 
          and high reliability, Elixir is the way to go.
