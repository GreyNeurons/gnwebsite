          <p>Cockroaches are known for their tenacity and often quoted as the most likely survivors of a nuclear war. There are more than 4,000 species of cockroaches worldwide and they have been around for more than 280 million years. Cockroaches can live without food for one month & can live for weeks without their head. So cockroaches have come to represent ability to survive in toughest of tough environment & are often being used to highlight survivability attribute of a company, product or a person. 
          </p>
          
          <p>
            1. Unicorn startups are well known but cockroach startups often get into limelight especially when the starting funding dries up. Wikipedia definition of cockroach startup is 
            <blockquote>
                A cockroach is a business that - from inception forward - grows gradually and progressively.[1] It puts a specific emphasis on revenues as well as profits and ensures a tight cost control in order to make its growth especially robust as far as finances are concerned.[2] Oftentimes these cockroaches are more resilient and thus considered a less risky investment than "unicorns"
            </blockquote>
            <span class="has-text-warning">So if you are an entrepenuer or founder, it may be good to think like cockroach atleast sometimes and not go after unicorn all the time.
            </span>
          </p>
            
          <p>2. If you are starting a new product/project/initiative whose usp is survivability, you may be better of naming it with something that starts with cockroach. Unusual naming will get the attention and also help you drive home your USP. E.g. CockroachDB  is a postgres compatible database with survivability and scalability as its main usp.
            <blockquote>
                CockroachDB stores copies of data in multiple locations in order to deliver speedy access.[5][10] It is described as a scalable, consistently-replicated, transactional datastore.[11] A single instance can scale from a single laptop to thousands of servers.[2] CockroachDB is designed to run in the cloud and has a high fault tolerance. According to popular news outlets, it is described as “almost impossible” to take down.[12][13][10]Even if multiple servers or an entire datacenter were to go offline, CockroachDB would not stop working.[14]
            </blockquote>

            <span class="has-text-warning">So if you are an engineer, think like cockroach to build a high quality product that can withstand all the failures and attacks.</span>

                        Stop worrying about AI taking up your job because as per a recent World Economic Forum  report the most advanced AI systems of today are still less evolved neurologically compared to a cockroach.

            <span class="has-text-warning">So stop worrying about how you will survive the onslaught of automation as computers have a long way to go before they can displace you.</span>
