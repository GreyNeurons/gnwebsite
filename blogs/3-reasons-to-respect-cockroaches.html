          <p>Cockroaches are known for their tenacity and often quoted as the most likely survivors of a nuclear war. It is also said cockroaches can live for weeks without their head. While use of unicorn to describe startups is well known, use of cockroaches to describe startups who can survive, technologies that are designed to be highly available etc.

            1. With the startup funding drying up, cockroach startups are IN, unicorns are OUT. Wikipedia definition of cockroach startup is 
            <blockquote>
                A cockroach is a business that - from inception forward - grows gradually and progressively.[1] It puts a specific emphasis on revenues as well as profits and ensures a tight cost control in order to make its growth especially robust as far as finances are concerned.[2] Oftentimes these cockroaches are more resilient and thus considered a less risky investment than "unicorns"
            </blockquote>
            <span class="has-text-warning">So if you are an entrepenuer or founder, it may be good to think like cockroach few times.
            </span>
          </p>
            
          <p>2. If you are starting a new product/project/initiative whose usp is survivability, you may be better of naming it with something that starts with cockroach. E.g. CockroachDB  is a postgres compatible database with survivability and scalability as its main usp.
            <blockquote>
                CockroachDB stores copies of data in multiple locations in order to deliver speedy access.[5][10] It is described as a scalable, consistently-replicated, transactional datastore.[11] A single instance can scale from a single laptop to thousands of servers.[2] CockroachDB is designed to run in the cloud and has a high fault tolerance. According to popular news outlets, it is described as “almost impossible” to take down.[12][13][10]Even if multiple servers or an entire datacenter were to go offline, CockroachDB would not stop working.[14]
            </blockquote>

            <span class="has-text-warning">So if you an engineer, think like cockroach to build a high quality product that can withstand all the failures and attacks.</span>

                        If you are worried about AI taking up your job, stop worrying because per the World Economic Forum  report as we the humans have still time on our hand as The most advanced AI systems of today is still less evolved neurologically than that of a cockroach.
