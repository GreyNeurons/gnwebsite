                <p>From a rapid 17-minute prototype generated by ChatGPT to 1–1.5 hours of real-world integration, cross-browser and mobile QA, and UX refinements. Real projects demand documentation, code reviews, and stakeholder feedback – often consuming 2–3× the initial coding time.</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Over the past few months, I’ve been on a Medium publishing spree – writing deep dives and how-tos for my growing audience. To make my work accessible to non-members, I mirror every post on my own static site: no fancy frameworks, just plain HTML and CSS. As traffic climbed, I found myself wishing there was a simple way for readers to share these articles across their social networks.</p>
                <p>These days, whenever I want to do any coding, I just ask ChatGPT. For most small tweaks and feature add-ons, it’s a lean, lightning-fast way to get exactly what I need without the overhead of heavyweight AI or non-AI based Dev tools. Adding a social share feature fit the bill of getting it done using AI.</p>
                <p>In this post, I’ll walk you through the exact prompts I used, the code we generated together, how long it took, and the lessons learned along the way.</p>
                </div>

                <h2>Here’s what I challenged ChatGPT (and myself) to deliver:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cross-platform support: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Bluesky, Email</li>
                    <li>Native share fallback: Use the Web Share API on supported browsers</li>
                    <li>Customizable: Allow passing page-url and page-title attributes</li>
                    <li>Zero dependencies: Vanilla JavaScript + Shadow DOM</li>
                    <li>Error handling: Gracefully degrade if template or APIs are unavailable</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <h2>The ChatGPT-Powered Workflow</h2>
                <p>Before diving in, I first had to pick the right ChatGPT model. Based on my earlier experiments comparing ChatGPT 4o and Claude Sonnet 3.7 for a JavaScript tool, I went straight for ChatGPT o4-mini-high. In the rest of the article, whenever I mention only ChatGPT or LLMs, I am referring to ChatGPT o4-mini-high.</p>

                <p>From there, I treated ChatGPT as a collaborative partner – tweaking prompts, refining output – until we arrived at a polished, reusable component.</p>

                <p>Here's are 9 prompts I gave to ChatGPT and approximate time spent prompting and reading the responses: </p>

                <p>Time spent in the ChatGPT session: ~17 minutes, plus an additional 1–1.5 hours of real-world integration and testing (including layout tweaks, browser and mobile QA).</p>

                <h2>Prompt Breakdown & Rationale</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>0–2:</strong> “Generate html component which has capabilities to share the current page…” Started with a minimal HTML + JS snippet to validate that ChatGPT could produce working share links for the current document.</li>
                    <li><strong>2–4:</strong> “Can this be a html component” Prompted ChatGPT to wrap the initial snippet into a reusable Web Component using Shadow DOM for encapsulation.<br><strong>Key insight:</strong> LLMs often produce bare-minimum code by default, so you must explicitly prompt ChatGPT to wrap your snippet into a reusable Web Component with Shadow DOM to ensure encapsulation and reusability.</li>
                    <li><strong>4–6:</strong> “Have you done all kinds of error handling?” Ensured robustness by prompting for try/catch blocks, template checks, and graceful fallbacks on unsupported browsers.<br><strong>Key insights:</strong> LLMs don't automatically include robust error handling – you must explicitly prompt for try/catch blocks, template-existence checks, and graceful fallbacks on unsupported browsers to ensure reliability.</li>
                    <li><strong>6–8:</strong> “Give capabilities to share on Bluesky” Expanded platform support by including a prompt to add Bluesky sharing integration alongside existing networks.<br><strong>Key insights:</strong> Reminder that you must explicitly list every platform you want, or explicitly prompt the model to add any you forgot.</li>
                    <li><strong>8–10:</strong> “How do I pass the pageurl, pagetitle from html page?” Made the component configurable by adding attributes for overriding the default URL and title values.<br><strong>Key insight:</strong> LLMs will hardcode values by default, so you need to explicitly prompt ChatGPT to parameterize the component by reading page-url and page-title attributes, making it configurable.</li>
                    <li><strong>10–12:</strong> “Rewrite as standalone JS file that programmatically injects the template” Consolidated the template injection and component definition into a single JS module for easy inclusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>12–14:</strong> “Nothing is rendering – explain why and how to fix” Debugged rendering issues by uncovering the need to append the &lt;template&gt; to the DOM before registration.<br><strong>Key takeaway (Real-world testing):</strong> There's no substitute for hands-on QA – thoroughly test the component across different browsers, screen sizes, and devices to catch layout quirks and compatibility issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>14–15:</strong> “Regenerate the single JS file again” Polished the standalone script after fixing the injection bug, ensuring the full code was self-contained.</li>
                    <li><strong>15–17:</strong> “How can I right-align with Bulma CSS?” Added layout prompts to align the component within a Bulma-based page design.<br><strong>Key insights:</strong> Prompted for layout tweaks using Bulma CSS, which proved that real-world integration – trial-and-error across different browsers, screen sizes, and devices from a UX perspective – is still indispensable.</li>
                </ol>

                <div>
                <h2>Caveats &amp; Gotchas</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>LinkedIn behavior:</strong> LinkedIn ignores any <code>text=</code> parameter and never pre-populates the compose box. Instead, it scrapes your page's OpenGraph tags for the preview. To ensure correctness, always include:
                    <pre><code>&lt;meta property="og:title" content="…"/&gt;
                &lt;meta property="og:description" content="…"/&gt;
                &lt;meta property="og:image" content="…"/&gt;</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Web Share API:</strong> Only available on secure contexts (HTTPS) and supported browsers (mobile Chrome, Safari, etc.). The component hides the native button on unsupported browsers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Template injection timing:</strong> If you inline <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> in JavaScript without injecting it into the DOM, <code>querySelector('#social-share-template')</code> will fail – leading to a hidden component. Always append the template before defining the element.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shadow DOM styling:</strong> Since styles are encapsulated, you can't easily override them from parent CSS. If your design needs full customizability, consider exposing CSS custom properties.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>
                <hr class="separator"></hr>
                <div>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>In under 20 minutes, I had my first code cut ready – proof of ChatGPT's rapid prototyping power. But turning that prototype into a polished feature took another 1–1.5 hours: integrating it into one of my blogs, fine-tuning layout, performing cross-browser and mobile QA, writing documentation, and gathering beta feedback.</p>
                <p>Just like any real-world project, “code complete” is only the beginning. Testing, documentation, code reviews, UX refinements, and stakeholder validation often consume 2–3× more time than writing the initial code. So when you hear someone say, “I built this in 17 minutes,” remember the many critical follow-up steps that make the feature production-ready.</p>
                <p>This experience also reinforces what I have written in my earlier articles: future developer roles will lean heavily on human-centered activities – system validation, integration, UX design, and cross-team collaboration – where empathy, judgment, and iterative feedback are key. ChatGPT speeds up coding, but the art of delivering high-quality code with seamless user experience still depends on human effort.</p>
