          <p>Recently in a code review session for a product under development, goto know the team was using Firebase for in app notifications. Looked like a reasonable choice nevertheless reminded me of the infamous story how a startup almost went bankrupt using Firebase. I shared the story with the team & apply learnings if any from the same.
          </p>

          <p>The story is really about how a startup got a bill of 72K USD overnight after launching their application. If you are interested you can read up the first part of the story <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href = "https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-1/">here</a>.
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Techies should NOT skip the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.tomilkieway.com/72k-2/">part 2 of the story</a> where the author talks about the code in his application that led to this and how he fixed it.
          </p>  

          <p>
          When the story was published, it was discussed quite a bit on internet. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25372336">Here</a> is one from Y Combinator forum.

            Generally, quite a few folks who adapted the cloud are rethinking and leaving the cloud. A recent example is <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a> & <a href="https://www.hey.com/">HEY</a> quitting on cloud. 
            
            It is estimated they reduce their $3 million annual AWS bill by an estimated 60% . 

            David Heinemeier Hansson, Co-Owner & CTO of Basecamp & HEY has written a nice article summarizing
              <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0">why he is leaving the cloud</a> . 
              
              According to the article, cloud makes sense only in following cases

              <blockquote>
                When your application is so simple and low traffic that you really do save on complexity by starting with fully managed services
              </blockquote>

              <blockquote>
                When you have wild swings or towering peaks in usage. When the baseline is a sliver of your largest needs. Or when you have no idea whether you need ten servers or a hundred
              </blockquote>


          </p>

          <p>
            Another example is from SEO crawler <a href="https://prerender.io/">PreRender</a> who reduced annual server costs by 80% — from $1M to $200k — by moving away from AWS. The whole journey has been documented in detail and can be read <a href="">here</a>. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A common thread why folks want to quit cloud appears to be their outbound data transfer costs. These clouds trap you by allowing you to upload data for free (ingress) but if you want to trasnfer out your own data ( egress), they will charge you a bomb.
