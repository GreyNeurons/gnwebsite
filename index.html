            If you are looking for a secured system programming language, C is a natural choice.
            But wait if you are starting fresh, we would rather recomend you to look at 
            <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> instead of C.
            
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p>
              Rust's memory safety features make it appealing especially comparing it to C.
              No wonder part of Linux kernel, Windows OS have started the migration from C to Rust. 
            </p>

            <br/>
            <br/>

            <p>
              GreyNeuron strongly believes Rust can not be ignored. If you have an existing product in C, 
              you may want to consider gradually rewriting some pieces of code into Rust.

            <p>
            <a href ="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> is the hammer of database. 
            It is not only battle proven SQL engine but also
            has a matured support for NOSQL elements via hkey store or jsonB column types.
            Postgres is also truly open source and will continue to be open source with a fantastic community supporting it.
            </p>

            <br/> 
            <p>
            In any software project worth its salt, you have usecases which need both SQL and NoSQL database. 
            So going with postgres helps you to implement all these help cases without going for additional databases
            reducing TCO during dev and production.
            </p>
            
            <br/>
            <p>
            GreyNeurons strongly recommends starting with Postgres and going to other database only if only need be.
